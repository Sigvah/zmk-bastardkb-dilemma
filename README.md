# ZMK BastardKB Dilemma v3 Firmware

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ZMK currently only supports full duplex comms, although half-duplex is a WIP.
> To satisfy this requirement, you will have to bodge a wire from `QP_RST` to the unconnected TRRS leg.

> [!CAUTION]
> Please refer to the [schematics of the BastardKB Dilemma v3](https://github.com/Bastardkb/Dilemma/tree/5f852b3897f45f490570cc9028ca9680d5b83355/3x5_3) to correctly identify the unconnected TRRS leg and `QP_RST` through-hole first before connecting them to avoid causing any electrical shorts.
