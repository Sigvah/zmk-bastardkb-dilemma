# ZMK BastardKB Dilemma v3 Firmware

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ZMK currently only supports full duplex comms, although half-duplex is a WIP.\
> To satisfy this requirement, you will have to bodge a wire from `QP_RST` to the unconnected TRRS leg.

> [!CAUTION]
> Please refer to the schematics of [the BastardKB Dilemma v3](https://github.com/Bastardkb/Dilemma/tree/bc36ea1f08bce4a09123f83e41df8776dfda028c/3x5_3_hotswap) to correctly identify the unconnected TRRS leg and `QP_RST` through-hole first before connecting them to avoid causing any electrical shorts.
